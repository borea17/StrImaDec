Reference Implementation for my thesis 

## Implementation Notes

- The implementation assumes that the virtual enviroment is installed in the main GIT directory, i.e., at the level where the `setup.py` file lies.

- Once you run the scripts for yourself, the results will be deleted. If the execution is interrupted, you may not be able to run with "--load". => this can be easily fixed by not storing the new results
